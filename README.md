IT IS LIVE AT https://samarthkolur.github.io/AstroScope/


AstroScope is an interactive web application that allows users to explore near-Earth objects and artificial satellites. This project provides a visually engaging experience with satellite data and 3D Earth visualizations, leveraging Three.js to render real-time models.

Features
Satellite Search: Users can search for specific satellites and retrieve key details such as discovery date, mission, size, and more.
3D Earth Visualization: Real-time 3D Earth model showcasing satellites orbiting the planet.
Autocomplete Search: A dynamic search bar that provides suggestions as the user types.
Satellite Details: Displays detailed information about the selected satellite in organized info boxes.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/samarthkolur/AstroScope.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd astroscope
Open the index.html file in your browser to explore the application.

Use the search bar to find satellites by name. Click on suggestions to view satellite details in real-time.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS: Styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: Core functionality, satellite search, and Three.js for 3D visualization.
Three.js: Used to render the 3D Earth and satellite visuals.
